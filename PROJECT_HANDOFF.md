---

## 📋 ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS

I want to build a web app that I can deploy on Vercel with a backend on Google Cloud Run using FastAPI + Playwright.

### 🌐 Overview
This web app allows a user to upload a student spreadsheet and a target form URL. The backend cleans and validates the spreadsheet, then uses Playwright automation (headless, off the user's device) to fill out and submit each student's information on that webpage.

**Architecture**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (chosen) deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Playwright on Google Cloud Run
- **Runtime**: Browser automation runs on Cloud Run (never locally)
- **Automation scope**: All target URLs share the same HTML structure (same form layout, different links)
- **Target Form**: https://www.goarmy.com/info?iom=CKXG-XX_LAP_Exhibit_2897052_C04_NA_ROTC

### 📄 Required Spreadsheet Format
Excel file with these EXACT headers (case-sensitive, order matters):
```
Email Address | First Name | Last Name | Phone | Date of Birth | Zip Code
```

Example data:
```
bsavila03@gmail.com | Brithany | Avila | 7088828259 | 3/16/2007 | 60163
tordyeet@gmail.com | Bennett | Navarrete | 7086166634 | 9/1/2007 | 60104
```

## 🔄 REQUIREMENTS CHANGES & CLARIFICATIONS

### During Development, These Clarifications Were Made:

#### 1. Phone Number Handling (CHANGED)
**Original**: "Phones – digits only; must be 10 digits → else skip"
**Updated**: Extract digits from formatted phone numbers
- `(636) 480-1423` → `6364801423` ✓ (mark as "fixed")
- `636-480-1423` → `6364801423` ✓ (mark as "fixed")
- Only skip if not exactly 10 digits after extraction

#### 2. ZIP Code Handling (CHANGED)
**Original**: "ZIP = 5 digits → else skip"
**Updated**: Extract first 5 digits
- `60163-1234` → `60163` ✓ (mark as "fixed")
- Only skip if not exactly 5 digits after extraction

#### 3. Tab 1 Unfixable Rows Display (CLARIFIED)
**Requirement**: Unfixable rows MUST be displayed on screen with ALL fields visible
- User should NOT need to download anything to see what needs fixing
- Show: Email, First Name, Last Name, Phone, DOB, ZIP for each skipped row
- Make it easy for user to identify and fix in Excel

#### 4. Download Cleaned Spreadsheet (CLARIFIED)
- Downloaded file contains ONLY valid rows (ok + fixed)
- Skipped rows are EXCLUDED from download
- But skipped rows remain VISIBLE on screen for user reference

#### 5. Data Persistence (ADDED)
- Use **localStorage** to persist data across browser refresh
- Only cleared when user clicks "Clear" button
- Survives page reload

#### 6. Clear Button (ADDED)
- Clears: URL + spreadsheet data + file input + localStorage
- Allows starting fresh with new spreadsheet

#### 7. Tab 2 Access (CHANGED)
**Original**: "If no unfixable rows remain, enable moving to Tab 2"
**Updated**: Tab 2 is ALWAYS accessible
- If unfixable rows exist, they're just skipped during submission
- No need to block Tab 2 access

#### 8. Target URL Input (CLARIFIED)
- **NO default URL** in the app
- User MUST provide URL each time
- Can be saved in sessionStorage after entered
- Placeholder changed to: "Paste the link here" (simple and direct)

#### 9. Duplicate Detection (ADDED)
- Detect duplicates by email OR name+DOB combination
- Mark duplicates as "skipped"
- Warn user about duplicates

#### 10. Max Rows (ADDED)
- Hard limit: 2000 rows maximum per spreadsheet

#### 11. Submission Controls (ADDED)
- **Start Submission** button
- **Pause** button (tracks position, can resume)
- **Continue** button (resumes from paused position)
- **Kill Switch** button (full stop, requires starting over - no resume)

#### 12. Live Log Display (CLARIFIED)
- Show EVERY row (success + failure)
- Green text for success
- Red text for failure
- Auto-scroll to latest entry

#### 13. Submit Button Safety (ADDED)
- During testing/development: submit button NOT clicked (`submit=False`)
- This prevents accidental submissions to Army website during development
- User can manually test first, then enable auto-submit later

#### 14. Checkbox Selection Optimization (ADDED)
- Page has 10 total checkboxes (most hidden/unrelated)
- Only need to click last 2 checkboxes (the consent ones)
- Use direct selectors instead of searching all checkboxes
- IDs: `#checkbox-3863ad55eb-1-input` and `#checkbox-3863ad55eb-2-input`

### Phase 2: Backend - Spreadsheet Cleaning & Validation ✓
**Git Commit**: `aeb10a2` - "Phase 2: Implement spreadsheet cleaning and validation backend"

**Files Created**:
1. `backend/validators.py` - All validation and cleaning functions
2. `backend/cleaner.py` - SpreadsheetCleaner class
3. `backend/main.py` - Added POST `/clean` endpoint
4. `backend/test_cleaner.py` - Comprehensive test suite
5. `backend/create_sample_data.py` - Test data generator
6. `backend/sample_students.xlsx` - Sample file with 12 rows

**Validation Logic Implemented**:

```python
# 1. Date of Birth
- Pad to MM/DD/YYYY: "3/7/2007" → "03/07/2007"
- Future year → current_year - 16: "1/1/2025" → "01/01/2009"
- Year < 1950 → skip (unfixable)

# 2. Phone Number
- Extract digits: "(636) 480-1423" → "6364801423"
- Must be exactly 10 digits after extraction
- Mark as "fixed" if transformed, "skipped" if invalid

# 3. ZIP Code
- Extract first 5 digits: "60163-1234" → "60163"
- Must be exactly 5 digits
- Mark as "fixed" if transformed, "skipped" if invalid

# 4. Names (First & Last)
- Regex: ^[A-Za-zÀ-ÖØ-öø-ÿ' -]+$
- Allow: letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, accented chars
- Skip if contains digits or invalid symbols

# 5. Email
- Standard email regex validation
- Convert to lowercase
- Skip if malformed

# 6. Duplicate Detection
- Check for duplicate email
- Check for duplicate name+DOB combination
- Mark duplicates as "skipped"
```

**Status System**:
- `ok`: Valid, no changes needed
- `fixed`: Auto-corrected successfully
- `skipped`: Unfixable, requires manual correction

**API Endpoint**:
```python
POST /clean
- Accepts: Excel file upload
- Returns: {
    success: true/false,
    results: [{row_number, status, note, data}, ...],
    summary: {ok: 2, fixed: 5, skipped: 5, total: 12},
    cleaned_file: "base64_encoded_excel",
    filename: "cleaned_students.xlsx"
}
```

**Test Results**:
- Sample file: 2 OK, 5 Fixed, 5 Skipped, 12 Total ✓
- All tests passing ✓

### Phase 4: Backend - Playwright Form Automation ✓
**Git Commits**:
- `34c6a71` - "Phase 4: Implement Playwright form automation with selector discovery"
- `31eb91b` - "Fix checkbox automation with JavaScript click approach"
- `95a3f38` - "Optimize checkbox selection with direct selectors"

**Files Created**:
1. `backend/inspect_form.py` - Form inspection tool (one-time use)
2. `backend/find_all_inputs.py` - Input field discovery tool
3. `backend/form_automation.py` - FormAutomation class
4. `backend/FORM_SELECTORS.md` - Selector documentation

**Form Selectors Discovered** (ONE-TIME, work for ALL URLs):

```python
SELECTORS = {
    'email': 'input[id*="email" i]',           # → #ebrc-3863ad55eb__ebrc-emailAddress
    'first_name': 'input[id*="first" i]',      # → #ebrc-3863ad55eb__ebrc-firstName
    'last_name': 'input[id*="last" i]',        # → #ebrc-3863ad55eb__ebrc-lastName
    'phone': 'input[id*="phone" i]',           # → #ebrc-3863ad55eb__ebrc-phoneNumber
    'dob': 'input[id*="dob" i]',               # → #ebrc-3863ad55eb__ebrc-dob
    'zip_code': 'input[id*="zip" i]',          # → #ebrc-3863ad55eb__ebrc-addressZip
    'consent_checkbox_1': '#checkbox-3863ad55eb-1-input',  # First consent checkbox
    'consent_checkbox_2': '#checkbox-3863ad55eb-2-input',  # Second consent checkbox
    'submit_button': 'button.form-submit'      # "GET MORE INFORMATION" button
}
```

**FormAutomation Class**:

```python
class FormAutomation:
    async def start():
        """Launch Playwright browser (headless)"""
    
    async def stop():
        """Close browser"""
    
    async def fill_form(url, student_data, submit=False, max_retries=3):
        """
        Fill form with student data
        
        Steps:
        1. Navigate to URL
        2. Fill email field
        3. Fill first name
        4. Fill last name
        5. Fill phone
        6. Fill date of birth
        7. Fill ZIP code
        8. Wait 1 second
        9. Click consent checkbox 1 (using direct JavaScript)
        10. Click consent checkbox 2 (using direct JavaScript)
        11. Optionally click submit button (if submit=True)
        12. Return success/failure
        
        Retry Logic:
        - 3 attempts on failure
        - 2-second delay between retries
        - Handles network errors
        - Handles page timeouts
        """
```

**Checkbox Implementation** (Optimized):

```javascript
// Direct JavaScript execution (no searching!)
const checkbox1 = document.querySelector('#checkbox-3863ad55eb-1-input');
const checkbox2 = document.querySelector('#checkbox-3863ad55eb-2-input');

if (checkbox1 && !checkbox1.checked) checkbox1.click();
if (checkbox2 && !checkbox2.checked) checkbox2.click();
```

**Why Direct Selectors?**:
- Page has 10 total checkboxes (most are hidden UI toggles)
- We only need the last 2 (consent checkboxes)
- Direct selectors are faster and more reliable
- No need to search through all checkboxes

**Safety During Testing**:
- `submit=False` parameter prevents actual form submission
- Allows testing all fields and checkboxes
- User can verify everything is correct before enabling submission
- **Submit button is NOT clicked during testing**

**Test Results**:

```
✓ Email filled
✓ First Name filled
✓ Last Name filled
✓ Phone filled
✓ DOB filled
✓ ZIP filled
✓ Consent checkbox 1 checked: True
✓ Consent checkbox 2 checked: True
✓ Form filled (NOT submitted - testing mode)
Success: True
```

**Playwright Installation**:
```bash
playwright install chromium  # Chromium browser installed
```

### Phase 5: Backend - Submission API & State Management ✓
**Git Commits**: Multiple commits for implementation and bug fixes

**Files Created**:
1. `backend/submission_manager.py` - SubmissionManager class with state tracking
2. Updated `backend/main.py` - Added 5 new endpoints

**Endpoints Implemented**:

```python
POST /submit
- Input: {url: string, students: Array<{row_number, data}>}
- Action: Start async submission process
- Response: {success: true, message: "Started submission: N students"}

GET /status
- Returns: {
    status: "idle" | "running" | "paused" | "completed" | "killed",
    current_position: 3,
    total: 7,
    completed: 2,
    failed: 1,
    elapsed_seconds: 45,
    log: [{row, status, student, timestamp, error?}],
    errors: ["Row 3: Network timeout"]
  }

POST /pause
- Action: Set state to paused at current position
- Response: {success: true, message: "Paused"}

POST /resume  
- Action: Resume from paused position
- Response: {success: true, message: "Resumed"}

POST /kill
- Action: Stop completely and cleanup
- Response: {success: true, message: "Killed"}
```

**SubmissionManager Class**:
- Singleton pattern (one instance per server)
- Manages FormAutomation lifecycle
- Tracks submission state and progress
- Handles pause/resume/kill operations
- Stores logs and errors
- Calculates elapsed time
- Skips rows with `status: "skipped"`
- Processes only `status in ["ok", "fixed"]`
- Includes 0.2 second delay between students for browser stability

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Uses `asyncio.create_task()` for background processing
- State stored in memory (resets on server restart)
- FormAutomation instance created per submission
- Browser closed when submission completes/kills
- Retry logic inherited from FormAutomation (3 attempts per student)

---

### Phase 6: Frontend - Tab 2 Submission Interface ✓
**Git Commit**: Tab 2 implementation with real-time tracking

**File Updated**:
- `frontend/components/Tab2Submit.tsx` - Complete implementation

**Features Implemented**:

✅ **Data Loading**:
- Loads cleaned data from localStorage on mount
- Displays summary: "X students ready (Y with valid data)"
- Shows target URL from Tab 1
- Validates data exists before allowing submission

✅ **Control Buttons**:
- **Start Submission** (Green) - Initiates batch submission
- **Pause** (Yellow) - Pauses at current position
- **Resume** (Blue) - Continues from pause point (shown only when paused)
- **Kill Switch** (Red) - Stops completely, requires restart

✅ **Real-Time Progress Display**:
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Counter: "X / Y Completed"
- Client-side timer (increments every 1 second locally)
- Status indicator (Running, Paused, Completed, Killed)

✅ **Live Log**:
- Shows every submission attempt
- Green ✓ for success
- Red ✗ for failure
- Auto-scrolls to latest entry
- Displays: Row #, Student Name, Status, Error (if failed)
- Timestamp for each entry

✅ **Final Summary** (on completion):
- Total success/failure counts
- Elapsed time
- Failed rows table with details
- Each failed row shows: Row #, Student Name, Email, Error message

✅ **Status Polling**:
- Polls backend `/status` endpoint every 1 second
- Updates UI with latest progress
- Independent client-side timer for smooth display
- Stops polling when not running

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: Second Submission Hanging on Row 3

### **Current Problem Statement**:

The application works perfectly for the FIRST submission:
- User uploads spreadsheet → Tab 1 cleans data → Tab 2 submits all students → Success ✅

However, when user tries a SECOND submission (after Clear + Refresh or just restarting):
- Row 1 (student 2): ✅ Succeeds
- Row 2 (student 3): ❌ **HANGS INDEFINITELY**
- Pause button does NOT respond during hang

### **Observed Symptoms**:

From terminal logs:
```
First Submission:
INFO:submission_manager:Processing Row 2: Brithany Avila
INFO:form_automation:Navigating to: [URL]
INFO:form_automation:Filling email: bsavila03@gmail.com
INFO:form_automation:Filling first name: Brithany
...
INFO:form_automation:✓ Form filled (NOT submitted - testing mode)
INFO:submission_manager:✓ Row 2: Success - Brithany Avila

INFO:submission_manager:Processing Row 3: Bennett Navarrete  
INFO:form_automation:Navigating to: [URL]
...
(All 7 students succeed) ✅

Second Submission (same data):
INFO:submission_manager:Processing Row 2: Brithany Avila
INFO:form_automation:Navigating to: [URL]
INFO:form_automation:Filling email: bsavila03@gmail.com
INFO:form_automation:Filling first name: Brithany
...
INFO:submission_manager:✓ Row 2: Success - Brithany Avila

INFO:submission_manager:Processing Row 3: Bennett Navarrete
(No "Navigating to:" log appears)
(Just GET /status polling continues indefinitely) ❌
```

**Key Observations**:
1. First student succeeds in second submission
2. Second student never starts (no navigation log)
3. Process appears stuck before `fill_form()` is called
4. No error logs, just silent hang
5. Pause button sends request but doesn't actually pause

### **Root Cause Analysis**:

The issue is related to Playwright browser/context/page lifecycle management. The problem occurs when trying to reuse or recreate browser components after a previous submission has completed.

**Playwright Architecture**:
```
Browser (Chromium process)
  └── Context (isolated session)
        └── Page (browser tab)
```

**Issue**: After first submission completes:
- Browser is properly closed
- On second submission, new browser is created
- But something in the context/page management causes hanging

### **Debugging Attempts & Current Implementation**:

#### **Attempt 1**: Reuse Single Context Across All Students
**Commit**: `b5c6b64` - "Major fix: Reuse single browser context/page across all students"

**Approach**:
```python
# In start()
self.context = await self.browser.new_context()  
self.page = await self.context.new_page()

# In fill_form() - reuse same page
await self.page.goto(url)
await self.page.fill(...)
```

**Result**: ❌ First submission works, second submission hangs on Row 3
**Problem**: `page.goto()` was timing out (30 seconds) on the second student

---

#### **Attempt 2**: Create Fresh Page Per Student
**Commit**: `234057c` - "Fix: Create fresh page per student to avoid navigation timeout"

**Approach**:
```python
# In fill_form() - create new page for each student
if self.page:
    await self.page.close()
self.page = await self.context.new_page()
await self.page.goto(url)
```

**Result**: ❌ Even first student failed
**Problem**: Closing and immediately creating pages caused `page.fill()` to hang

---

#### **Attempt 3**: Track Page Usage with Flag
**Commit**: `f22eb0f` - "Fix: Track page usage to avoid recreating page for first student"

**Approach**:
```python
# Add flag to track if page has been used
self.page_used = False

# In fill_form()
if self.page_used:
    # Close old page, create fresh one
    await self.page.close()
    self.page = await self.context.new_page()

await self.page.goto(url)
# ... fill form ...

self.page_used = True  # Mark as used after success
```

**Result**: ❌ STILL HANGING on second submission at Row 3
**Current Status**: This is where we are now

        await self.automation.start()
        # Start background task
        self.task = asyncio.create_task(self._process_submissions())
    
    async def _process_submissions(self):
        """Background task to process students"""
        while self.state['current_position'] < self.state['total']:
            # Check for pause/kill
            student = self.students[self.state['current_position']]
            
            # Call fill_form
            result = await self.automation.fill_form(
                url=self.url,
                student_data=student['data'],
                submit=False  # Testing mode
            )
            
            # Update state based on result

            # 0.2 second delay between students
            await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
```

### **What We Know**:

✅ **Working**:
- First submission completes successfully (all students)
- Browser/context/page creation works initially
- Form filling logic is correct
- Checkboxes click properly
- First student in second submission succeeds

❌ **Not Working**:
- Second student in second submission hangs
- No error is thrown (silent hang)
- Hang occurs BEFORE `page.goto()` is called
- Possibly related to `page.close()` or `context.new_page()`

### **Hypotheses to Test**:

1. **Context State Issue**: The context might be in a bad state after first student success
   - Even though we're creating "fresh" pages, the context might hold state
   
2. **Async Timing Issue**: There might be a race condition between:
   - `page.close()` completing
   - `context.new_page()` being called
   - Some internal Playwright cleanup

3. **Browser Process Issue**: The browser process itself might need to be restarted between submissions
   - Currently we only restart browser on errors, not between submissions

4. **Page Close Hanging**: The `await self.page.close()` call might be hanging
   - No timeout on page.close()
   - Could be waiting for something that never completes

### **Suggested Next Steps for New Agent**:

1. **Add comprehensive logging** around page lifecycle:
   ```python
   logger.info("Before page.close()")
   await self.page.close()
   logger.info("After page.close()")
   logger.info("Before context.new_page()")
   self.page = await self.context.new_page()
   logger.info("After context.new_page()")
   ```

2. **Add timeout to page.close()**:
   ```python
   await asyncio.wait_for(self.page.close(), timeout=5.0)
   ```

3. **Try recreating context instead of page**:
   ```python
   if self.page_used:
       await self.page.close()
       await self.context.close()
       self.context = await self.browser.new_context()
       self.page = await self.context.new_page()
   ```

4. **Try restarting browser between submissions**:
   - In `submission_manager.py` after first submission completes
   - Before starting second submission

5. **Check Playwright documentation** for best practices on:
   - Page reuse vs recreation
   - Context lifecycle management
   - Browser cleanup

### **Testing Instructions**:

```bash
# Backend
cd /Users/ericyung/Desktop/form-pipeline/backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd /Users/ericyung/Desktop/form-pipeline/frontend
npm run dev

# Test flow:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Upload sample_students.xlsx
3. Clean spreadsheet
4. Go to Tab 2
5. Click "Start Submission"
6. Wait for completion (all 7 students succeed) ✅
7. Click "Clear" button
8. Refresh page
9. Upload same file again
10. Clean spreadsheet
11. Go to Tab 2
12. Click "Start Submission" again
13. Watch logs - Row 2 succeeds, Row 3 hangs ❌
```

## 🔄 COMPLETE DATA FLOW

### Upload & Cleaning Flow (Tab 1):
```
1. User uploads Excel file + enters target URL
   ↓
2. Backend validates headers (exact match required)
   ↓  (If headers wrong → immediate error)
   ↓
3. Backend processes each row:
   - Clean phone (extract digits)
   - Clean ZIP (extract 5 digits)
   - Clean DOB (pad to MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Validate names (regex)
   - Validate email (regex)
   - Check for duplicates
   ↓
4. Each row gets status: ok / fixed / skipped
   ↓
5. Frontend displays:
   - ALL rows in table (color-coded by status)
   - Summary counts (ok/fixed/skipped/total)
   - Unfixable rows warning (if any)
   - Download button for cleaned file
   ↓
6. User downloads cleaned file (excludes skipped rows)
   ↓
7. Data saved to localStorage (persists across refresh)
```

### Submission Flow (Tab 2 - TO BE BUILT):
```
1. User switches to Tab 2
   ↓
2. Frontend loads cleaned data from localStorage
   ↓
3. User clicks "Start Submission"
   ↓
4. Frontend sends request to POST /submit
   ↓
5. Backend starts processing:
   For each ok/fixed row:
     - FormAutomation.fill_form(url, data, submit=True)
     - Log success/failure
     - Update progress state
     - Skip any "skipped" rows
   ↓
6. Frontend polls GET /status every 1-2 seconds
   ↓
7. Frontend updates UI:
   - Progress bar
   - Counter "370 / 700"
   - Timer "2m 35s"
   - Live log (green success, red failure)
   ↓
8. On completion:
   - Final summary
   - Failed rows table
   - Download log option
```

### localStorage Structure:
```javascript
{
  targetUrl: "https://www.goarmy.com/info?iom=...",
  results: [
    {
      row_number: 2,
      status: "fixed",
      note: "Phone formatted: (636) 480-1423 → 6364801423",
      data: {
        "Email Address": "test@example.com",
        "First Name": "John",
        "Last Name": "Doe",
        "Phone": "6364801423",
        "Date of Birth": "03/16/2007",
        "Zip Code": "60163"
      }
    },
    // ... more rows
  ],
  summary: {
    ok: 2,
    fixed: 5,
    skipped: 5,
    total: 12
  },
  cleanedFile: "base64_encoded_excel_data...",
  filename: "cleaned_students.xlsx"
}
```

## 🔑 KEY DECISIONS & CONSTRAINTS

### Critical Constraints:
1. ❌ **NO default URL** in the app - User must always provide
2. ❌ **Submit button NOT clicked during testing** - Safety measure
3. ✅ **Skipped rows excluded** from downloaded file
4. ✅ **Unfixable rows shown on screen** - No download needed to see them
5. ✅ **Data persists in localStorage** - Cleared only by Clear button
6. ✅ **Tab 2 always accessible** - Will skip invalid rows during submission
7. ✅ **Direct checkbox selectors** - Optimized, no searching
8. ✅ **Max 2000 rows** per spreadsheet

### Design Decisions:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (chosen for Vercel compatibility)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (chosen for rapid development)
- **State**: localStorage (chosen for simplicity and persistence)
- **Form Automation**: Playwright with Chromium (headless)
- **Checkbox Strategy**: Direct JavaScript click with exact selectors
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch with retry logic (3 attempts)

### Testing Strategy:
- Backend: Unit tests for validators
- Frontend: Manual testing with sample data
- Automation: Test mode (`submit=False`) first
- Integration: End-to-end flow testing
- User can test ONE submission manually before batch processing

## 🚀 INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW AGENT

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Current Status

**App is 95% complete BUT has a CRITICAL BUG preventing production use!**

**What works**: First submission of any spreadsheet works perfectly  
**What's broken**: Second submission hangs on Row 3 (Playwright lifecycle issue)

### Step 1: Read This File Completely
This file contains:
- ✅ Phases 1-6 complete (all features built!)
- ❌ **CRITICAL BUG**: Second submission hanging issue
- 📊 Detailed debugging history (3 attempts made)
- 🎯 Suggested next steps to fix the bug
- 📁 Complete code state

### Step 2: Understand the Bug
**READ THE "CRITICAL ISSUE" SECTION ABOVE CAREFULLY**

Key points:
- First submission: Works perfectly ✅
- Second submission: Hangs on Row 3 ❌
- Issue: Playwright page/context lifecycle management
- Location: `backend/form_automation.py` lines 98-107
- Symptom: Silent hang (no errors), just stops processing

### Step 3: Test and Reproduce
```bash
# Start backend
cd /Users/ericyung/Desktop/form-pipeline/backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --port 8000

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd /Users/ericyung/Desktop/form-pipeline/frontend
npm run dev

# Test flow (see detailed steps in "Testing Instructions" section above)
# You WILL reproduce the bug on second submission
```

### Step 4: Debug Approaches to Try

**Priority 1**: Add comprehensive logging
- Log before/after `page.close()`
- Log before/after `context.new_page()`
- Identify exactly where it hangs

**Priority 2**: Add timeouts
- `await asyncio.wait_for(self.page.close(), timeout=5.0)`
- Catch timeout exceptions

**Priority 3**: Try recreating context
- Instead of just page, recreate context too
- See suggested code in "Hypotheses to Test" section

**Priority 4**: Research Playwright docs
- Best practices for page lifecycle
- Context reuse vs recreation
- Browser cleanup between sessions

### Step 5: DO NOT Start New Features
- Phase 7-10 can wait
- Docker deployment can wait
- **MUST FIX THIS BUG FIRST**
- App is unusable without fix

### Step 6: Commit Pattern
Continue the debugging commit pattern:
```bash
git add backend/form_automation.py
git commit -m "Debug: [What you tried]

- What change was made
- Result (success/failure)
- Next steps"
git push
```

### Key Files to Focus On:
1. `backend/form_automation.py` - **THE FILE WITH THE BUG**
2. `backend/submission_manager.py` - May need changes too
3. Test with `sample_students.xlsx` (7 rows is sufficient)
